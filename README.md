# Ferocia Take Home Test — Term Deposit Calculator

> React web app for a term deposit interest calculator, developed as a take-home developer assessment for Ferocia.

The calculator is a React app, using create-react-app as a starting point. TailwindCSS is used for component styling.

## Running the app

You can run the app by first cloning it, then installing the required packages, and finally running it —

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harrison-broadbent/td-calculator.git
cd td-calculator

npm install

npm run start
```

## Running the tests

There are a few basic tests for the app itself, and some more extensive tests for the actual interest rate calculation function.

You can run the tests by running —

```bash
npm run test
```
